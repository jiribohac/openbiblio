# Openbiblio 7.2
This is an updated version of OB 7.2 that has support for PHP 7.0+. OB only supported PHP 5, and I used the PHP MAR tool to help upgrade to PHP 7.0.

## Install
Follow installation instructions in the html file. See [openbiblio](http://obiblio.sourceforge.net/) for more informaton.

### Notes
Some of the newer reports do not work. Also, this was hand done and may have bugs. OB is under the GNU license, my modification is legal.

Make sure to add your own information under database_constants.php matching your SQL server.
