# Openbiblio 7.2
This is an updated version of OB 7.2 that has support for PHP 7.0+. OB only supported PHP 5, and I used the PHP MAR tool to help upgrade to PHP 7.0.

## Install
Follow installation instructions in the html file. See [openbiblio](http://obiblio.sourceforge.net/) for more informaton.

### Notes
Everything should work properly. This was hand done and may have bugs. OB is under the GNU license so I believe I can do this.
